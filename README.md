AirBnB Clone
AirBnB Clone is a project that creates a Command Line Interface (CLI) program that can be used to manage objects for a simulated AirBnB platform. The goal of the project is to provide a high-level overview of how the AirBnB platform functions and to explore the use of different programming concepts, such as classes, objects, inheritance, and data storage.
