AirBnB Clone                                                                                                                    
This is a project that creates a command line interface program that can be used to manage objects for an AirBnB platform. The g
oal of the project is to provide a high level overview of how the AirBnB functions and to explore the use of different programmi
ng concepts.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                
Command interpreter                                                                                                             
The AirBnB clone command interpreter is a program that reads in commands from the user and performs various actions on the vario
us objects. The program is written in python and utilizes various design patterns.                                              
                                                                                                                                
Using the command interpreter                                                                                                   
Once the command interpreter is running, you can input the commands to interact with the AirBnB objects. The available commands 
are as follows:                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                
quit: Exits the command interpreter

create: creates a new object

destroy: destroys an object
